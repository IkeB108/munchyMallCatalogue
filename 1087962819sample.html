SAMPLE BUYER'S GUIDE 12-16-2021
by Qwerty_2001
==================
- This sample book lists only a few products. The full book lists every product that can be purchased in shops at the Munchy Survival Mall at the time of writing. Items may be out of stock.
- This guide will gradually become outdated over time. Purchase an updated one at my shop (shop 78)!
Thank you,

TIPS
- Press Ctrl+F to search this catalogue.
- To visit the nth shop, use this command in the chat: /shoptp n
- For each item, the deals are sorted by unit price (best value = first)
- Some shops are poorly lit. Consider using a night vision resource pack
    (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/night-vision)
- Consider donating to shops that offer especially good deals. After all, you want them to stick around!
- NOTE: Banners of all colors and patterns are listed here as 'White banners'. They are not all white!
